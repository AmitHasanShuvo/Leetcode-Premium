## Description

Given two lists `A`and `B`, and `B` is an anagram of `A`. `B` is an anagram of `A` means `B` is made by randomizing the order of the elements in `A`.

We want to find an *index mapping* `P`, from `A` to `B`. A mapping `P[i] = j` means the `i`th element in `A`appears in `B` at index `j`.

These lists `A` and `B` may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

For example, given

```
A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
```



We should return

```
[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
```

as `P[0] = 1` because the `0`th element of `A` appears at `B[1]`, and `P[1] = 4` because the `1`st element of `A` appears at `B[4]`, and so on.



**Note:**

1. `A, B` have equal lengths in range `[1, 100]`.
2. `A[i], B[i]` are integers in range `[0, 10^5]`.

## python solution

方法一：

```python 
class Solution:
    def anagramMappings(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        return list(map(lambda c: B.index(c), A))

```

方法二（使用哈希表）：

```python 
class Solution(object):
    def anagramMappings(self, A, B):
        D = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(B)}
        return [D[x] for x in A]
```
