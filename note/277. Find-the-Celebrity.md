## Description

Suppose you are at a party with `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`, your function should minimize the number of calls to `knows`.

**Note**: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

## python solution

直接**暴力搜索**，时间复杂度为`O(n^2)`,竟然通过了。

n个人，编号分别为`0 ~ n - 1`, 思路如下：

- 根据名人定义，`其他所有人都认识他，但他不认识其他任何人`。以`i`为基准对其他所有人进行判断。如果`i`**认识任何其他人**或者**任何其他人不认识`i`**，那么`i`**一定不是名人**。如果i通过了所有的判断，则i就是**名人**。
- 如果没有任何一个人满足上面条件，则**没有人是名人**。



```python 
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# @param a, person a
# @param b, person b
# @return a boolean, whether a knows b
# def knows(a, b):

class Solution(object):
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # 假设0不是名人
        for i in range(0, n):
            isCele = True
            for j in range(0, n):
                # i不应该认识任何人，任何人都应该认识i
                if j != i and (knows(i, j) or not knows(j, i)):
                    isCele = False
                    break
            if isCele:
                return i
        return -1

```
