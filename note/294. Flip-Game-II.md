## Description

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two **consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: true
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
```

**Follow up:**
Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.

## python solution

```python 
class Solution:
    def canWin(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i:i + 2] == "++":
                if not self.canWin(s[:i] + "--" + s[i + 2:]):
                    return True
        return False
```

- 将每个“++”都尝试换成“—”，看对手能不能赢，如果对手不能赢，则我们就赢了。
